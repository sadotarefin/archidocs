TOGAF ADM Phases Explained:
Preliminary Phase:

Purpose: Identify who will do the work and define essential architectural principles and scope.
Adaptation: Architects tweak TOGAF to fit the specific needs of the project.

Phase A: Architecture Vision:

Business Request: The business formally requests architecture work, like a new point-of-sale system.
Goals and Scope: Define business goals and what is in and out of scope. For example, changes to integrated systems might be out of scope.
Output: An architectural statement of work and final approval from executive management.

Phase B: Business Architecture:

Current and Target States: Define the current and target business architectures.
Impact on Business: Model how business functions will change. For example, changes in inventory ordering or distribution logistics.
Output: A plan for how the business will adapt to the new system.

Phase C: Information Systems Architectures:

Data and Application Domains: Model changes needed in data and application architectures.
Integration: Document how the new system will integrate with existing systems.
Output: A generalized model of changes needed for the new system.

Phase D: Technology Architecture:

Technical Details: Define specific technical details like database platforms and integration protocols.
Blueprints: Create blueprints for physical and logical implementation.
Output: A comprehensive technical architecture model.

Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions:

Review and Finalize: Review all work done so far and make final decisions on outstanding choices.
Output: Implementation and migration strategies and a broadly defined implementation plan.

Phase F: Migration Planning:

Detailed Plan: Break down work efforts into prioritized sub-projects.
Critical Path: Define the sequence of dependent events.
Output: A detailed implementation plan.

Phase G: Implementation Governance:

Oversight: Oversee the building of the solution, ensuring alignment with the design.
Documentation: Document and approve design changes if needed.
Output: The completed system, integrated and rolled out.

Phase H: Architecture Change Management:

Ongoing Requirements: Monitor and govern incremental changes for the lifetime of the system.
New Iterations: Major changes may require a new iteration of the ADM.
